# Course-Reminder
A tool to show the upcoming course of your curriculum in your notification bar!

*so that you won't forget to take your classes anymore*

## Important Note
This is my first trial to develop using Android Studio(and Kotlin as well) so it is certain that there will be tons of low-level mistakes and not-recommended practices in this repo.
If you happened to find one please don't hesitate to PR or notify me. This will help me learn Android Studio better!

*I will not be responsible for any losses caused by using this repo without double-checking its logic.*
